## My Story

I grew up a rural area of central Maine where I spent much of my time snowboarding, camping, playing soccer, and messing around on my computer. 
After high school, I've had the privledge to study at Boston College, where I'm currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science. I'm a nationally certified EMT-B
and volunteer for Boston College's student-run EMS service, as well as an Army ROTC cadet.

## Experience

Languages and cybersecurity topics that I have experience with include:

* Java
* Python
* HTML/CSS
* OWASP Top 10
* Penetration Testing
* Webapp Vulnerability Scanning
