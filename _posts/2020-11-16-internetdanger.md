title: Internet: The Good, Bad, & The Ugly
---

There are few things we don’t trust in the hands of technology. We offer it our bank account information, social security numbers, and our exact location at all times among an almost ever-evolving list of private information. 

These are things that we would choose to share with only a few people in the world. Things that we would refuse to say aloud, and wouldn’t write down on paper.

Even so, many of us don’t think twice about entering this information into our phones, laptops, and devices. We, the users of technology, have chosen to stay blissfully unaware of the fact that our information is no longer private.

Partly to blame is the false sense of security that we receive from technology. We know that everyone else utilizes the same services that it provides, so what reason do we have to believe that something malicious is occurring behind closed doors?

For example, we attribute the oddity of receiving an advertisement from something we have said out loud to pure coincidence.

The users of the internet operate under the blanket assumption that it has the best of intentions. Rarely do we analyze a link before clicking it, or read the source code of scripts before running them as root. 

A tech-savvy person such as yourself surely mitigates the risk associated with using the internet. Perhaps you’re connected with multiple chained VPNs, or you test programs in a guest operating system before using them in your own.

We shouldn’t constantly be scared about data breaches or intimidated by surfing around the web. I simply suggest that we standardize a slight mistrust of the internet and its services. That we show others how to protect their information, and that each of us does not contribute to the misuse of online data.

The freedom associated with the internet is what makes it so valuable. Anyone can contribute, and vast networks of connections can be developed. Danger seems to simply be a byproduct of these privileges. 

In the words of Jonathan Zittrain: <br>

“We face paired dangers. The first is that our networks are successfully attacked. The second is that our fear of attack will cause us to destroy what makes the Internet special.”
