title: The Most Complex Network Vulnerability
---

A typical depiction of network vulnerabilities may involve established points of weakness, misconfigured systems, or overlooked areas of potential exploitation. Much of the technical analysis that goes into assessing the security of a network surrounds these concrete ideas of what a system is inherently vulnerable to on its ‘front lines’.

Historical breaches of security suggest, however, that one of the greatest threats to a network does not lie in its configuration or software. It lies instead in its authenticated users who are inherently susceptible to an infinite number of psychological exploits. 

Cybersecurity professionals and software developers have long been aware of the importance of securing their networks and applications. The result of this is that it has become much more difficult for an attacker to achieve a foothold in a network entirely from the outside. As firewall, encryption, and authentication technologies have exponentially increased in complexity, we have seen much fewer successful breaches from hackers that simply probe user-facing services for vulnerabilities. 
  
Instead, the complexity of these attacks has increased ten-fold by moving away from technical misconfiguration and towards individuals who have verified and legitimate access to sensitive areas of the network. For instance, leaving a USB stick containing malware in the parking lot of a secured facility could be a much more effective method of gaining a foothold than spending hundreds of hours enumerating services and attempting to access sensitive information via brute force. All it would take to compromise the network is one individual who is curious about the contents of the USB drive and who proceeds to insert it into their device.

Similarly, sending a malicious link over email to an individual using a particular network could result in the instant deployment of ransomware that could maintain complete control over an enterprise, all because of the inexperience of one person. Perhaps an even worse scenario is that the exploitation is invisible, and that the network administrators are completely unaware that it has been breached at all--much less that a back door to the network has been created all because of one seemingly innocuous hyperlink.

Educating users about concepts associated with cybersecurity is arguably just as important as hardening the user-facing aspects of a network or application. Even if it was possible for a network to be 100% secure from outside exploitation, internal vulnerabilities will always exist if legitimate users are susceptible to more psychologically focused attacks. By focusing resources on both improving user-facing security and educating authenticated users about general best practice, the overall security of a network can be increased substantially.
